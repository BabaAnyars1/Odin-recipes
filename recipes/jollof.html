    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Jollof (/dʒəˈlɒf/), or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. The
        dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices,
        vegetables and meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and
        preparation methods vary across different regions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that
        was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning parts
        of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. The
        dish has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne, containing
        rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially
        the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and
        urban centers, taking with them economic arts of "blacksmithing,
        small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy" as well as the religion of
        Islam.

        <li>
            1 ½ cups water (360 mL)
            </l1>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a
            blender and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the
            blender, and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining ⅓ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed
            pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the
            water has cooked out and the puree is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, garlic powder, ginger,
            dried herbs, and crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring
            occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep red in color.</li>
        <li>Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce
            the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for another
            30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
