    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        In Western and Central African cooking, fufu holds the same position as 
        mashed potatoes do in traditional European and American cuisine. 
        This staple dish is served with all kinds of soups, stews, and sauces, 
        and looks like a soft, slightly elastic white pur√©e of neutral taste.
    </p>
    <p>
        Depending on the country, the ingredients for fufu may differ. In Ghana, 
        fufu is most commonly made by mashing together cassava and unripe 
        plantains or yams. Fufu-like staples are widespread across the entire 
        Sub-Saharan Africa.

    <p>
        The history of fufu begins in the 16th century when the Portuguese 
        traders brought cassava to Africa from Brazil. This plant, also called 
        manioc or yuca, proved to be very resistant to droughts and soon spread 
        from the West to the East and South of Africa. The fufu was reportedly 
        invented in Ghana, and its name is simply an imitation of the sound the 
        wooden pestle makes during pounding. Interestingly enough, fufu is also 
        popular in the Carribean, where it was brought by African slaves. Nowadays, 
        fufu is an everyday side dish which can be prepared at home, either in a 
        traditional or modern manner, or ordered in local neighborhood chop bars. 
        As one of the Ghanaian national dishes, it is also regularly consumed on 
        their Independence Day, March 6th.

    <ul>
        <li>300 g (10 1/2 oz) un-ripened plantain</li>
        <li>460 g (16 oz) cassava</li>
        <li>350-450 ml (1 1/2 cup to 2 cups - 1 tbsp) water for blending</li>
        <li>50 ml (3 tbsp + 1 tsp) water for steaming</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            First, peel the plantain and cut it into cubes. Peel and scrape the 
            cassava, de-string it and also cut into cubes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, place the cassava and plantain into the blender. Add water: 
            for now, use 350 ml if you want fufu to be firmer, or 450 ml if you 
            prefer it softer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn the blender on and process the ingredients into a smooth paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, heat the paste in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir 
            constantly with a wooden spatula for 8 to 10 minutes to remove any lumps.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, add the remaining 50 ml of water to the mixture. Reduce the heat 
            to the lowest setting, cover with a lid and steam for another 8 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            After that, increase the heat to medium setting and stir. The fufu might 
            look too soft, but it will become firmer as it cools down.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the fufu into a bowl and sprinkle one teaspoon of water on 
            the surface to prevent forming a film. Let it cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape fufu into a ball and serve with soup or stew of your choice.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
    </ol>
